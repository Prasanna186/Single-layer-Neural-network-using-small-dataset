A single-layer neural network, often referred to as a single-layer perceptron (SLP), is a simple type of artificial neural network. Here‚Äôs an overview of how it works:

Structure
Input Layer: This layer consists of input neurons, which are directly connected to the output neurons. Each input neuron represents a feature of the data.
Output Layer: This layer consists of output neurons. In a single-layer perceptron, there's typically one output neuron, but you can have more depending on the problem (e.g., multiple classes in classification).
Operation
Input: Each input neuron receives a feature value from the dataset.
Weights: Each input is multiplied by a weight. The weights are parameters that the model adjusts during training.
Summation: The weighted inputs are summed up, and a bias term is added to this sum.
Activation Function: The result is passed through an activation function to produce the final output. Common activation functions for binary classification include the step function, sigmoid function, or sometimes the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function.

Training
Training a single-layer perceptron involves adjusting the weights and bias based on the errors it makes during predictions. The Perceptron Learning Algorithm is often used, which updates the weights and bias in response to errors. For a single-layer perceptron used in binary classification, the update rules might look like this:

Prediction: Compute the output

y using the current weights and bias.

Error Calculation: Determine the error by subtracting the predicted output from the actual target value.

Weights Update: Adjust the weights and bias to reduce the error. This can be done using a learning rate
